The findsign module extracts the parking sign from the image.  It
returns a sub image with as little noise as possible, however there
may be some non-letter objects in the image, such as bolts, arrows,
etc.

The method I used in a previous project of using edge detection +
contours and looking for contours with straight sides and rectangular
shape worked reasonably well.
