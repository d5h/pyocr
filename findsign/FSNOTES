The findsign module extracts the parking sign from the image.  It
returns a sub image with as little noise as possible, however there
may be some non-letter objects in the image, such as bolts, arrows,
etc.

The grid + entropy by itself seems to be a pretty poor method after
all.  I used a passband of [0.02,0.12] empirically with an 8x8 grid on
binarized images, and it did an ok job of filtering through the sign,
but also let through a lot of noise.  The grid is also very course.
We could refine it, but I think working with a binary image, it's just
too hard to filter text on a background from other orderly looking
objects, such as powerlines against a sky.  The grid method might be
useful as a single classifier used with others, but I think we can
probably do without it by finding a better method.

The method I used in a previous project of using edge detection +
contours and looking for contours with straight sides and rectangular
shape worked reasonably well.

Using the tightening rectangle with entropy is terrible and extremely
slow (although it doesn't have to be if we can memoize the scoring
function on subsections).
